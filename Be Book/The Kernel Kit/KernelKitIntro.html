<P>
The Kernel Kit is a collection of C functions that let you define and control the contexts in which your application operates.  There are five main topics in the Kit: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><a href="Threads.html#Threads%20and%20Teams">"Threads and Teams"</a>.  A thread is a synchronous computer process.  By creating multiple threads, you can make your application perform different tasks at (virtually) the same time.  A team is the collection of threads that your application creates.
<P>
<LI><a href="Ports.html#Ports">"Ports"</a>.  A port can be thought of as a mailbox for threads:  A thread can write a message to a port, and some other thread (or, less usefully, the same thread) can then retrieve the message.
<P>
<LI><a href="Semaphores.html#Semaphores">"Semaphores"</a>.  A semaphore is a system-wide counting variable that can be used as a lock that protects a piece of code.  Before a thread is allowed to execute the code, it must acquire the semaphore that guards it.  Semaphores can also be used to synchronize the execution of two or more threads.
<P>
<LI><a href="Areas.html#Areas">"Areas"</a>.  The area functions let you allocate large chunks of virtual memory. The two primary features of areas are:  They can be locked into the CPU's on-chip memory, and the data they hold can be shared between applications.  
<P>
<LI><a href="Images.html#Images">"Images"</a>.  An image is compiled code that can be dynamically linked into a running application.  By loading and unloading images you can make run-time decisions about the resources that your application has access to.  Images are of particular interest to driver designers.
<P>

The rest of this chapter describes these topics in detail.  The final three sections...
<P>
<UL>
<LI><a href="System.html#System%20Information">"System Information"</a>, 
<P>
<LI><a href="Time.html#Time%20Information">"Time Information"</a>, 
<P>
<LI>and <a href="misc.html#Miscellaneous%20Functions%20and%20Constants">"Miscellaneous Functions and Constants"</a>
<P>
</UL>
<P>
...fill in the gaps.
